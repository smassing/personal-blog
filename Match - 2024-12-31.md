My favorite quote:
"My father says that almost the whole world is asleep. Everybody you know. Everybody you see. Everybody you talk to. He says that only a few people are awake and they live in a state of constant total amazement."
- Patricia to Joe, in Joe vs. the Volcano

I'm working on waking up.


US
Our story is not yet written, but I have been thinking about the pages that we will write our story on together.  This is what I hope some of those pages look like:

We laugh and grow and stumble and grieve together, partners in the beauty and mess of life.  We share the silly and serious moments because that is where joy is found.

Our table is a sacred space. With friends, family, or just us. Whether we are at home, on the town, sharing a perfectly cooked meal, or simply takeout. Every meal is a opportunity to connect, reflect, and celebrate.  

We talk.  Really talk. We are present to each other. We share our stories, our dreams, our frustrations, and our fears.  Respect is the foundation we build everything on.

We stomp in puddles, walk in the rain, get a little muddy, get goofy together, and create moments that leave us with great stories.

We are inspired by life and this world we live in—its quiet moments of peace, its bursts of joy, and the wonder tucked into the everyday. Together, we embrace it all with gratitude and open hearts.


A LITTLE ABOUT ME
I worked with middle and high school students professionally for 20+ years. Now I spend my days working for the government at a strange self-created intersection of law, technology, art and education. It's exciting and challenging and I get to make a difference in a different way. I still volunteer weekly with teenagers.

The teenagers variously describe me as "having excellent Spotify playlists," being their "most favorite middle-aged white man,"  and being too old to use the term "slay" convincingly in conversation.  Of that last one, they are not wrong.

Raised Catholic. I believe there is something bigger than us.  Call it Science, call it God, call it Margaret, or Bob.  I don't know.  I'm not interested in dogma anymore.  I am simply humbled and awed by the bigness and the smallness of the universe.

Travel. Photography. Music. Books. Movies. Pizza. Sarcasm. Mountains. Roadtrips. Dogs. Cheese. This is a list of nouns.
